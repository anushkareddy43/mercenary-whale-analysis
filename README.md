Mercenary Whale Clustering is a Python Streamlit app using KMeans to identify "whales" in crypto transactions, visualizing 50 transactions with Seaborn ("Amount (Units)" and "Value (USD)" axes) and a styled DataFrame, with a sidebar slider filtering high-value transactions (default $10,000) and synthetic data if no CSV is provided.
